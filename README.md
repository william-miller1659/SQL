# William "David" Miller's SQL

# Welcome to my portfolio! This is a simple collection of some SQL work I have completed. There are three main projects to see basic, moderate, and advanced SQL skills and are labeled respectively. The other projects are just random collections of code for dataset I used for training. Feel free to take a look around and email me if you have any questions, comments, or concerns; william.miller1659@yahoo.com
